# VisitorManagementSystem
Overview:
Onewhero Bay Heritage Park, nestled in the picturesque Northland region of New Zealand, is a renowned tourist destination featuring
a rich array of attractions including a museum, a nocturnal kiwi house, native bird and reptile exhibits, and a unique marae. With the
anticipation of a surge in visitors during the upcoming summer season, the park seeks to modernise its operations by implementing
a comprehensive visitor management system.
Rangitira IT has been entrusted with the development of the solution. The solution can either be a desktop or a web-based solution.
Key Requirements:
1. Visitor Registration: Develop a user-friendly web application allowing visitors to register online for park visits and special
events. Visitors should provide essential details such as name, contact information, and areas of interest.
2. Event Booking: Enable visitors to browse and book tickets for upcoming special exhibitions, animal encounters, and other
events hosted by the park.
3. Visitor Tracking: Implement a backend database to store visitor information, including registration details, interests, and event
bookings. The system should facilitate efficient tracking of visitor demographics and preferences.
4. Information Dissemination: Provide visitors with access to comprehensive information about the park, its attractions,
upcoming events, and facilities through the website.
5. Promotional Tools: Enable the park administrators to leverage visitor data for targeted marketing and promotion of future
events. This includes sending personalised event recommendations based on visitor interests.
6. Data Analytics: Incorporate analytical capabilities to generate insights from visitor data, such as visitor demographics, popular
attractions, and event attendance patterns.
Technological Specifications:
1. Development Platform: Develop applications in any suitable platform. You can use C#.netâ€™s WPF framework for a desktopbased solution. Alternatively, you can use ASP.NET or a similar platform for seamless web integration and a user-friendly
interface.
2. Database Management: Employ SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or similar) for database management to ensure efficient data
storage and retrieval.
3. Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes to cater to
a diverse visitor base.
